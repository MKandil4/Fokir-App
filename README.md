## 🔧 Built With:
✔️ HTML

🧠 New Techniques I Practiced:
🔸 Flexbox layout structuring for flexible and responsive design.
🔸 Use of media queries to ensure responsiveness across devices.
🔸 Integration of Google Fonts for enhanced typography.
🔸 Icons integration using Font Awesome.
🔸 Smooth navigation with scroll-behavior: smooth.
🔸 Creative backgrounds using linear-gradient.
🔸 Advanced positioning techniques (relative, absolute, fixed) for precise layout control.
🔸 Managing element stacking with z-index layering.
🔸 Interactive hover effects on portfolio items using opacity.
🔸 Subtle animations and interactivity with transform: scale.
