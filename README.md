🧠 New Techniques I Practiced in This Project:
🔸 Integration of Google Fonts for enhanced typography.
🔸 Icons integration using Font Awesome.
🔸 scroll-behavior: smooth for seamless navigation.
🔸 Creative backgrounds using linear-gradient.
🔸 Float-based layout structuring.
🔸 Advanced use of position (relative, absolute, fixed) for layout control.
🔸 Layering with z-index to manage element stacking
🔸 Interactive hover effects on portfolio items using opacity.
🔸 transform: scale for subtle animations and interactivity.
